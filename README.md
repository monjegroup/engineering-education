Research outcomes for the NSF RIEF Project # 2407487: Computational notebooks as scaffolds to 
consolidate threshold concepts in an undergraduate introductory statistics course in chemical engineering.

[Public Abstract available here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2407487&HistoricalAwards=false):
This project will provide objective analysis of computational notebooks as tools to engage and 
facilitate learning of statistics for undergraduate students in engineering. Data collected during 
the project will serve to inform the design principles of computational notebooks and produce an 
evaluation rubric for the notebook design in terms of learning outcomes, student interaction and performance.
As a direct result of the proposed research, there will be measurable and objective improvements to an 
undergraduate statistics course in chemical engineering. Upon completion of this project, the research team 
will contribute to the engineering community systematic, evidence-based computational notebook design guidelines 
to facilitate student learning in engineering. The research outcomes align with the mission of the RIEF program 
and the project deliverables will benefit the communities of educators and researchers affiliated with the American
Society for Engineering Education, the American Institute for Chemical Engineers Education Division, and Computer 
Aids for Chemical Engineering.

A literature review providing the context and scope of the study was presented at the ASEE Annual Meeting in 
Montreal, Quebec, Canada in June 2025. The paper submitted to the conference proceedings accessed here:

The static versions of the notebooks designed for the initial phase of this study are posted in this repository. 
The respective topics include:
Notebook_1: Sample & Population

Notebook_2_part_1: Types of random variables and general formulas

Notebook_2_part_2: Linear functions of Random variables
